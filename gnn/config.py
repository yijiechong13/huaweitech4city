"""
Shared constants. EMBED_DIM is the one you must change to match whatever
sentence-embedding model you plug in upstream (e.g. LaBSE=768,
multilingual-e5-base=768, paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2=384).
Everything downstream (the message graph's input projection) reads from this
constant, so changing it here is enough to re-fit the whole pipeline to your
embeddings.
