"""
Creates nested, stratified subsets of dataset/train.jsonl at 25%/50%/75%
sizes, for a learning-curve experiment: train at each size, plot val
macro-F1 against dataset size. If it's still climbing at 100%, the model
is data-limited -- collect more. If it's flattened, more data won't help
much and the bottleneck is elsewhere (features/architecture/label quality).

Stratification: binary_conversation_label is kept exactly 50/50 (safe /
harmful) in every subset -- that's the point of stratifying at all, so
size is the only thing varying between files, not class balance. Within
the harmful half, the 3 typed harm categories (scam/cyberbullying/
grooming) are split as equally as possible, scarcest first -- but
cyberbullying (77 total) and grooming (102 total) aren't plentiful enough
for perfectly equal three-way representation past ~58% of the dataset. Once
a category's pool is exhausted, the remainder of the harmful quota goes to
the next-scarcest category with room left (see the printed report for the
exact counts actually used per file -- don't assume equal thirds without
checking it).

Nested by construction: each category's pool is shuffled once (seeded),
then increasing-length prefixes are taken per fraction -- so the 25%
subset is a strict subset of the 50% subset, which is a strict subset of
the 75% subset.

dataset/train.jsonl itself is the 100% split (unchanged, no new file).
dataset/validation.jsonl is not touched -- use it as the fixed eval set
across all four sizes so results are comparable.
